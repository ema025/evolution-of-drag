	<div class="text1"><h3>Drag is about creating <strong>space</strong> and creating <strong>validity</strong> for people who want to express gender differently and by their own rules.</h3>From this once-shielded subject sprung ball culture, the LGBTQ sub-community that embraced cross-dressing as a <strong>competitive art-form</strong> worth highly sought after trophies and prizes. Vogueing and other dance forms, shading and reading became themes and joke tactics, a subculture that always puts form before function.<br><br><br>
  	<h3>An arduous process which takes <strong>hours</strong> to perfectly transform, has gained momentum and the attention of younger generations.</h3> Most queens lip-sync to popular songs, perform comedy or talent shows in bars as a source of entertainment. Drag works as a <strong>modern haven</strong> and <strong>land of honey</strong> for those who dare to live and perform outside the norms of gender and sexuality.

	<div class="text3"><h3>As long as there's been theatre, there's been drag.</h3>Drag was first used to exclude women from the arts because they were considered vastly <strong>inferior</strong> to men and unfit for the stage. Japan had a similar practice where <strong>Kabuki</strong>, which actually began as a female only discipline, <strong>banned women</strong> so all parts were played by male actors. Kabuki is a Japanese <strong>dance theatre style</strong> where elaborate costumes are used and was considered a form of erotic entertainment.</div>
  	<div class="text4"><h3>In the Victorian Era, men would dress in long and heavy skirts to perform.</h3>The term <strong>“drag”</strong> most likely came from this type of dress since it literally dragged along the stage.  This occurred alongside a transition from more presentational styles of performance to the naturalistic world of <strong>playwrights</strong> in which actors generally portrayed characters of their own gender. Eventually, though, this era of theatre gave birth to arguably the most famous example of cross-gender casting, the title role in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>, a male part audiences not only accept played by a woman, but expect to be played by a woman.

Minorities and LGBT people flocked to be part of these parties that would have drag queen or <strong>"pansies”</strong> as the main attraction.</div>

In 1969, police tried to conduct a <strong>raid</strong> of the only LGBTQ+ bar <strong>(The Stonewall Bar)</strong> in the area at the time, but brave men and women fought back. Fed up with constant police harassment and social discrimination, drag queens like Marsha P. Johnson and other neighbors stood outside the bar rather than dispersing.</div>
  	<div class="text8"><h3>Within minutes, a full-blown <strong>riot</strong> with hundreds of people began. </h3>The police, a few prisoners, and a writer barricaded themselves in the bar, which a mob attempted to set on fire. The fire department and a riot squad were eventually able to douse the <strong>flames</strong>, rescue those inside Stonewall, and disperse the crowd. But the protests, involving thousands of people, continued in the area for <strong>five</strong> more days. Although the Stonewall uprising didn’t start the gay rights movement, it was a <strong>galvanizing force</strong> for LGBT political activism.

	  <div class="tip26box">Just like Lucy Schwob and many other, major artists have helped document the practice of drag in paintings, photography, and film. </div>
	  <div class="tip27"></div>
	  <div class="tip27box">Taking drag out of traditional contexts and into the art world helps it to evolve and gain the artistry it rightfully deserves.</div>
	  <div class="tip28"></div>
	  <div class="tip28box">Lucy Schwob is most remembered for her highly staged self-portraits and tableaux that incorporated the visual aesthetics of surrealism. </div>
	  <div class="tip29"></div>
	  <div class="tip29box">Trecartin’s installation tell stories of fame, including the labor of mediating that fame, suggesting that the artists are using the biennale to interrogate their own rise as celebrities in the art world.</div>
	  <div class="tip30"></div>
	  <div class="tip30box">Images like these are tangible records of powerful human connections in fragile times.</div>
	  <div class="figure6"></div>
	<div class="text11"><h3>Artists who similarly challenge and deconstruct rigid social and sexual archetypes have essentially brought art to a traditional art sense.</h3> Claude Cahum was the gender-ambiguous name for Lucy Schwob. She took self-portraits dressed in male garments as statement pieces about oppression and the female persona. Artists alike use drag-female personas to critique social issues because as long as it deconstructs identity categories, it will be considered drag. </div>
  	<div class="text12"><h3>Ryan Trecartin’s works in the 2000s were considered some of the most proto-Drag Race pieces of work that most closely resembles drag today.</h3> His work was included in Berlin’s Biennale that was titled “The Present in Drag”. The curated show was intended to be a space for artist to reflect contemporary culture onto itself, rather than expose it. With live drag performances in galleries, people will actually pay attention to the artistry. Unfortunately, a lot of performance art get de-legitimized because it is drag and not in a frame. Taking it out of traditional contexts and into the art world helps it to evolve and gain the artistry it rightfully deserves.

	<div class="text141"><h3><strong>Andy Warhol</strong> was driven by a fixation on identity, artifice and role-playing, a love affair with the most glamorous and fashionable drag queens of the time. </h3>In Andy Warhol’s own words, “people began identifying a little more with drag queens, seeing them more as <strong>'sexual radicals'</strong> than as depressing losers... That's how in '68... people started accepting drag queens - even courting them, inviting them everywhere…”. He wanted capture the <strong>glamorous</strong> world that played physicality off against idealized beauty.<br> <br>
  	<h3>What stood out about his work with drag queens, was that at the time, drag queens weren’t accepted in the <strong>mainstream world</strong>. </h3>Warhol said that they were “<strong>living testimony</strong> to the way women used to want to be, the way some people still want them to be and the way some women still actually want to be.”. He even dabbled in drag himself and photographed himself as part of the collection.  In many ways he did more to bring them into the mainstream than anyone else of that era.

	  <div class="tip48"></div>
	  <div class="tip48box">The youtube shows’s premise was as they explain in the first episode: “Welcome to the show we talk about whatever.” “And in whatever way we want to.” “Because it’s not your show.” “It’s ours.”. </div>
	  <div class="tip49"></div>
	  <div class="tip49box">Katya said in an interview with the Daily Beast, “The world is falling apart! Why not listen to two goons in dresses? You could learn something!”.</div>

	<div class="text19">The Trixie and Katya Show is a television series that features former Rupaul’s Drag Race contestants <strong>Katya Zamolodchikova</strong> and <strong>Trixie Mattel</strong>. The show is a spin-off of the Youtube series, UNHhhh, which features both drag queens speaking on different topics each week behind a green screen and funky animations. The comedic duo’s chemistry is unmatched and is no surprise that their dity-minded antics have appealed to more than the ordinary drag race fan. <br> <br>
	Drag icons Trixie and Katya examine life's most <strong>important</strong> issues, from love and sex, to fear and death, one topic at a time. With current political climates, drag exists to be joyous, defiant, and <strong>inspirational</strong> statement pieces. Their show serves as a place to speak on taboo subjects while showing that there is light even in the darkest subjects. Both are in various states of drag, belying a discussion that nimbly navigates seriousness and <strong>outlandishness</strong> as we talk about the upcoming watershed in their careers.
